Est time: 6 hours
Tools used:

1. Vue2
2. JS

## Notes and Things to Consider

1. Create Button and OrderList components and import into OrderView component.
2. Incorporate css framework eg: Bootstrap, TailWind, Material UI
3. Install css preprocessor such as sass to improve clean css code. Move css to dedicated scss files for each component. Create global css variables. Create mixins to reuse styles.
4. Implement a loader to let users know order is currently processing
5. Challenge: tested reduceBot(). it removes bot from array and prevent further processing. However, it does not stop the current order from being processed to completion.
